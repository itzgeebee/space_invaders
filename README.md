Space invaders game made with python

## About the game
[Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. 
It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed to the Midway division of Bally for overseas distribution. 
Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. 
The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.

## Project Background
I was tasked with recreating this epic game as one of #100 days of code projects. 
I used the [python turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library for the project and it was fun making it. 
I took the [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) approach for the project.

## Dependencies
- Python. I used version 3.9 for this project. Here's the instruction to install [python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)
- The [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) is a library that is present within the python. No pip installs need to be run.
